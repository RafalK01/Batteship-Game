# Batteship-Game

In the game of Battleship, two players each have a fleet of ships that they place on a grid. They then take turns guessing the locations of their opponent's ships by calling out coordinates, and the first player to sink all of their opponent's ships wins.


In my version the player can place their ships by dragging and dropping them, and the computer randomly places its ships. The placeShip() function is used for both computer and player to place their ships, and the getValidity() function checks if the placement is valid. The game information is displayed using the gameInfo element. The flipShip() function flips the orientation of the player's ships. The startButton element is used to start the game. User or computer wins when the all of the ships of the counterpart are sunk.

To create this game I used my JavaScript, HTML, CSS and p5.js knowledge aquired during first 2 weeks of IRONHACK bootcamp.
